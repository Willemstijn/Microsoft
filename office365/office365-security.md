### How to Disable Security Defaults for an O365 Customer

MFA being enforced automatically is happening because of Microsoft's new Security Defaults. This setting can be found in the Azure Active Directory Admin Center by clicking:

``Azure Active Directory > Properties > Manage Security Defaults > select Yes or No > press Save. ``
 
We've disabled the Security Defaults for your O365 tenant so you should be able to sign in now without the MFA prompt. Please keep in mind you can re-enable the Security Defaults at any time in the Azure Active Directory Admin Center.
